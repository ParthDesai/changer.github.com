       <span class="project-date">October 2012</span>
      <p>
        Traditionally, financial predictions are abacadabra to schoolboard members. Planners find it hard to communicate financial data to board members. This app tries to build a bridge between them by allowing board members to play around with a number of parameters and seeing how they affect their finances over the years.

      <p>
        The Permit Board uses permits, isolations and SAP equipment status to support rig staff in making informed decisions about work permits.
        It does this in a visual way, using rig plots to show permit locations and BowTie diagrams to visualize conflicts between multiple isolations.
        The Permit Board has been installed on Noble's Clyde Boudreax rig.

       <span class="project-date">July 2012</span>
      <p>
        For Nationale Nederlanden we designed and built an application that makes personal pension information easily accessible. An important element of the app was to help customers gain knowledge about pensions. A game element was added to make this gaining of knowledge fun and competitive.
